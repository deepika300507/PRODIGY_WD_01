    <h1>Whale</h1>
    <h3>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen whale.The blue whale is usually solitary, but can be found in pairs. When productivity is high enough, blue whales can be seen in gatherings of more than 50 individuals</h3>
     <h3>Blue whale typically swim at 2–8 kilometers per hour (1.2–5.0 mph) but may swim faster at 32–36 kilometers per hour (20–22 mph) during encounters with boats, predators or other individuals.</h3>
  <h3>Blue whales live around 80–90 years or more.Each year, a light and dark layer of wax is laid corresponding with fasting during migration and feeding time.</h3>
   <h3>The oldest blue whale found was determined, using this method, to be 110 years old.</p>
<h3>The idea that a blue whale senses its impending death and performs one final, intentional dive to the deepest part of the ocean is a popular internet narrative, but it is not supported by scientific evidence. </h3>
